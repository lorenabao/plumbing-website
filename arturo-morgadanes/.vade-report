# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
- Package added to dependencies in package.json
- package-lock.json updated with new dependency tree

### 2. Modified Files
**app/layout.tsx**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after all other components (CookieConsent)
- The component is properly nested within the existing LanguageProvider context

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices:
- Analytics component is imported from '@vercel/analytics/next' (the Next.js-specific version)
- Component is placed in the root layout file (app/layout.tsx) to track analytics across all pages
- Positioned inside the body tag after the {children} and other UI components
- Preserves all existing code structure and functionality

## Testing & Verification

✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
✅ TypeScript compilation passed with no errors
✅ All 35 pages/routes generated correctly
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics tracking
- Analytics data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard once deployed
- The component works alongside the existing GoogleAnalytics implementation
